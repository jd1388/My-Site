    Terra was going to be a platform for users to post services that they need done at their residences (lawncare, snow
    removal, etc.). After a user made a post, another user could complete the tasks in the post, then get paid through
    Terra.I was working on this project with a group of friends. We were working on the first iteration of the project, which 
    consisted of users being able to create postings that other users could complete. The only services that we were going to
    handle initially was lawncare, but we were going to slowly add other services. I was responsible for the frontend design.
    I set up the Terra frontend to use React, and we used Redux for handling client-side data.

  description: `
    I was with a few friends when they started talking about bubble wrap. One of them mentioned that they couldn't believe 
    that there wasn't a cookie clicker-like game for bubble wrap. So I broke out the laptop and made it happen. In the 
    process of making the game, I learned some practical skills like how to store a cookie on a user's browser and how to 
    create images. This was also the first website I tried to turn into a progressive web app.

export const giphySearch = {
  name: 'Giphy Search',
  description: `
    I created Giphy Search because I wanted to try some new React features, and I have wanted to try using a public API 
    extensively for some time. My friends like their memes, so I had a group of people who could ask for features. Thus 
    Giphy Search was born. Giphy Search wraps the Giphy API, specifically their search, trending, and random APIs.

    This is a project that I led for one of my classes. The goal of Code Couch was to build a platform that mixed together 
    aspects of GitHub, Trello, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow in a single website. The project was built using React and 
    Redux for the frontend and had a Node Express backend.

  description: `
    This is another project that I did for one of my classes. The idea behind WalkMeHome as to have a navigation app 
    that would allow someone to "walk you home". The way we did this was having one of the user's friends on the app 
    watch their progress while walking to their destination. This way, the user could walk knowing that if they stopped 
    suddenly, someone would know that something wasn't right. We built our app using React Native, and the backend for 
    it was built with Node Express.
