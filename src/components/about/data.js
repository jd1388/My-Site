const introduction = `
  My name is Jared Griffin. I'm a software engineer in the Des Moines area who recently graduated from
  college at Iowa State University. Through my experience in my career along with the many side project
  that I've worked on with my friends, I've become a fluent web developer with experience working on the
  entire stack. I have also invested a lot of time in becomming involved in the DSM tech community, helping
  with outreach through groups like TechJourney and trying to attend user groups like WebGeeks and dsmjs. I
  also learned how to lead people from my experience of serving as President of Iowa State's student branch
  of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and being a member of the Electrical and Computer
  Engineering Department's Student Advisory Committee. When I'm not knee-deep in projects, I'm probably
  playing video games, trying to learn how to serve in tennis, or disc golfing with friends.
