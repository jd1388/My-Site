        I worked on a team of apprentices to create a mobile app for service technicians for John Deere 
        dealerships so that they can update their locations with details on what they are doing. The mobile 
        app was built using React Native so that we could develop for Android and iOS at the same time. We are 
        also using AWS lambdas to proxy OAuth 1.0a requests that we need to make to John Deere.
