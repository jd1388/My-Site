                At ISU, I learned a lot about design patterns and best practices when building software. I 
                mainly focused in software development, expecially in frontend and web design.

                Here was where I discovered my love of programming by building robots for my high school's 
                robotics club. Later I would switch my focus to software development because I'm a far better 
                programmer than builder.

                I worked on a team rewritting the website for Adventureland Resort. This involved learning to 
                use PHP, specifically the Laravel framework, as well as using Vue JS for the first time, and using 
                Django for our CMS. With this project, I was also able to gain an understanding of cloud 
                infrastructure, specifically AWS and how CloudFormation works.

                I spent this summer working with a team on finishing an in-house application used by the Source 
                Allies business team to create resumes for consultants that they were trying to send to potential 
                clients. This is where I first learned how to use React and Redux, and we used Spring for our 
                Java backend.
