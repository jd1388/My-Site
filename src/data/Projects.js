        Terra is a platform for users to post services that they need done at their residences (lawncare, snow removal, etc.). 
        After a user makes a post, another user can complete the tasks in the post, then get paid through Terra. Currently I'm 
        working on this project with a group of friends. We are currently working on the first iteration of the project, which 
        consists of users being able to create postings that other users can complete. The only services that we will handle 
        initially is lawncare, but we will slowly add other services. I'm responsible for the frontend design. I've set up the 
        Terra frontend to use React, and we use Redux for handling client-side data.

        I created Giphy Search because I wanted to try some new React features, and I have wanted to try using a public API 
        extensively for some time. My friends like their memes, so I had a group of people who could ask for features. Thus 
        Giphy Search was born. Giphy Search wraps the Giphy API, specifically their search, trending, and random APIs.

        This is a project that I led for one of my classes. The goal of Code Couch was to build a platform that mixed together 
        aspects of GitHub, Trello, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow in a single website. The project was built using React and 
        Redux for the frontend and had a Node Express backend.

        This is another project that I did for one of my classes. The idea behind WalkMeHome as to have a navigation app 
        that would allow someone to "walk you home". The way we did this was having one of the user's friends on the app 
        watch their progress while walking to their destination. This way, the user could walk knowing that if they stopped 
        suddenly, someone would know that something wasn't right. We built our app using React Native, and the backend for 
        it was built with Node Express.
